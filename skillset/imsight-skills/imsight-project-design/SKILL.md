# Imsight Project Design

## Overview

Use this skill as an Imsight project-design umbrella for designing staged aspects of a development project. The current supported scope is feature planning, so the available subcommands create or revise feature-design planning artifacts.

The skill behaves like a main command with subcommands: complete the requested project-design stage within the supported scope, report what changed, then pause unless the user explicitly asks for another stage.

This skill is portable across host projects. Do not assume a specific repository layout, package name, planning framework, or source tree beyond files the user provides or files discovered in the active host project.

## When to Use

- Use for explicit Imsight project-design or Imsight SOP requests.
- Use for the supported feature-planning stages listed below.
- Use `manual-refine` for conversational, user-directed design decisions that must be recorded as ADRs and propagated across existing artifacts.
- Use command form such as `$imsight-project-design use define-feature to ...`, or infer the narrowest command from a task-only request.
- Do not assume a host-project layout beyond user-provided or discovered files.

## Workflow

When this skill is invoked, execute these steps in order.

1. **Select a subcommand** from the **Subcommands** table. If the user wrote `use <subcommand>`, use that subcommand. If the user provided a task prompt without a subcommand, infer the narrowest applicable subcommand. If no subcommand is named and the task is ambiguous, run `help`.
2. **Resolve the feature design directory** when the current feature-planning subcommand writes artifacts. See **Feature Planning Output Directory**.
3. **Load the command detail page** from the **Subcommands** table and execute its workflow.
4. **Pause after the subcommand**. Summarize created or changed files, unresolved decisions, and the likely next subcommand. Do not continue into another stage unless the user explicitly asks.

If the task does not map cleanly to the currently supported feature-planning workflow, explain the closest available subcommand and ask for the missing decision before writing artifacts. If the task concerns another project-design aspect, state that the skill is intended to expand in that direction but the current command set only supports feature planning.

## Subcommands

### Procedural Subcommands

| Subcommand | Use For | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scaffold` | Create a feature design directory and placeholder planning skeleton | `commands/scaffold.md` |
| `define-feature` | Create or update `<feature-dir>/feature-requirement.md` | `commands/define-feature.md` |
| `design-usecase` | Create or update one matched use case under `<feature-dir>/usecases/` | `commands/design-usecase.md` |
| `design-interface` | Create or update interface and contract docs under `<feature-dir>/design/` | `commands/design-interface.md` |
| `design-skill` | Generate a skill design overview under `<feature-dir>/design/<slug>/` for agent-skill features | `commands/design-skill.md` |
| `design-agent-task` | Create or update `<feature-dir>/agent-task.md` as an implementation handoff | `commands/design-agent-task.md` |

### Helper Subcommands

No helper subcommands are currently exposed.

### Misc Subcommands

| Subcommand | Use For | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `manual-refine` | Wait for user-directed refinements, record them as ADRs, and update affected design artifacts | `commands/manual-refine.md` |
| `help` | Explain this skill and list subcommands | `commands/help.md` |

## Feature Planning Output Directory

When output artifacts are involved, resolve the feature design directory in this order:

1. Use an absolute or host-project-relative output location explicitly provided by the user.
2. If no user location is provided and `IMSIGHT_SKILL_OUTPUT_DIR` is set, use that directory. Resolve relative values against the active host project directory.
3. If neither is provided, use `<host-project-dir>/.imsight-arts/feature-design/<YYYY-MM-DD-kebab-feature-name>/` with the current local date.

If the user gives an artifact root and a feature name, create or update `<artifact-root>/<YYYY-MM-DD-kebab-feature-name>/` unless the root already names the intended feature design directory. If the task appears to continue an existing feature, search the user-provided location, then `IMSIGHT_SKILL_OUTPUT_DIR`, then `.imsight-arts/feature-design/` for matching directory names, README titles, feature requirement titles, or use case summaries before creating a new directory.

Do not overwrite an existing feature design folder during `scaffold` unless the user explicitly asks. For update subcommands, preserve unrelated sections and revise only the target artifact.

## Current Artifact Contracts

`README.md`: Feature design index with purpose, status, artifact map, related context, and open questions.

`feature-requirement.md`: Feature requirement baseline with goal, non-goals, users or stakeholders, workflows, functional requirements, system boundaries, operational constraints, assumptions, and open questions.

`usecases/README.md`: Use-case index with identifiers, titles, status, and notes.

`usecases/uc-XX-<slug>.md`: One feature use case describing an actor-system or system-system workflow, supported actions, main flow, alternative/error flows, durable outputs, assumptions, and open questions. For agent-skill designs, include an example prompt and expected example AI response.

`design/README.md`: Design index and module/interface map.

`design/public-interfaces.md`: Default public interface and contract design file. Split into module-specific files only when the interface surface becomes large, files already exist, or the user asks for module files.

`design/<slug>/design-overview.md`: Skill design overview generated by the `design-skill` subcommand for agent-skill features. `<slug>` is derived from the proposed skill name in no more than six words.

`adrs/<NNNN>-<slug>.md`: A user-directed design decision or follow-up refinement recorded by `manual-refine`, with its current decision, affected artifacts, and refinement history. Create `adrs/` lazily when the first concrete refinement is applied.

`agent-task.md`: Compact implementation handoff with objective, use case references, design references, implementation instructions, verification expectations, required evidence, out-of-scope work, and open questions.

## Templates

Use placeholder templates from `assets/templates/feature/` when creating new files. `scaffold` copies only the baseline folder skeleton templates. Design subcommands may copy the more specific templates before replacing placeholders with substantive content. `manual-refine` uses `assets/templates/feature/adrs/adr.md` for new ADRs but does not add ADRs during scaffolding.

## Common Mistakes

- Running every subcommand end to end. Fix by completing the requested subcommand and pausing for review.
- Treating `scaffold` as design. Fix by copying placeholder templates only.
- Treating feature planning as the permanent boundary of this skill. Fix by preserving the project-design framing and recognizing feature planning as the current supported scope.
- Ignoring the Imsight output contract. Fix by resolving explicit user location, then `IMSIGHT_SKILL_OUTPUT_DIR`, then `.imsight-arts/feature-design/`.
- Creating duplicate use cases for the same workflow. Fix by matching existing use case titles, slugs, actors, goals, and summaries before choosing the next identifier.
- Designing interfaces without reading use cases. Fix by deriving commands, routes, schemas, files, events, storage contracts, or service boundaries from actual use case flows.
- Making `agent-task.md` too broad. Fix by writing minimal implementation instructions tied to stabilized feature, use case, and interface artifacts.
- Using `design-interface` to design an agent skill. Fix by invoking `design-skill` instead; `design-interface` writes non-skill interface and contract artifacts.
- Treating activation, questions, tentative suggestions, or unrelated conversation as refinements. Fix by recording only concrete decision-bearing instructions through `manual-refine`.
- Updating one artifact without propagating a recorded refinement to other affected design documents. Fix by running the `manual-refine` consistency review.
- Assuming a specific host project layout. Fix by inspecting the active project and using neutral project language unless the user provides project-specific conventions.
