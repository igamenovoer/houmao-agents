# Format Skill

## Workflow

Use this reference to revise a given skill so its structure conforms to the bundled style guide and its description is optimized for discovery. It applies to existing skills and to new skills created by `create`.

1. **Locate the target skill**. Resolve the skill folder from the user's request and confirm it contains `SKILL.md`.
2. **Load the local style guide**. Read `references/imsight-skill-style-guide.md`; do not rely on any style guide outside this skill directory.
3. **Read target skill files**. Read the target `SKILL.md`, `agents/openai.yaml` when present, and any directly linked subcommand, mode, workflow, primitive, or reference page that acts as an executable skill page.
4. **Identify style gaps**. Check **Formatting Checks** for the entrypoint and each subcommand-like page.
5. **Select the subcommand structure flavor** when the skill has subcommands. See **Subcommand Structure Checks**.
6. **Optimize the description**. Check **Description Optimization**.
7. **Revise structure in place**. Apply the smallest edits that make the target files conform while preserving skill meaning, public subcommands, trigger behavior, output contracts, and guardrails. See **Automatic Refactoring** for how to keep task-specific detail while conforming to the format.
8. **Synchronize links and metadata** when structural edits change subcommand labels, reference paths, or help text.
9. **Validate**. Run the available skill validator on the target skill and inspect changed files for remaining style gaps.
10. **Report results**. Summarize changed files, validations run, and any unresolved style issues.

If the user's task does not map cleanly to these steps, use your native planning tool to build a step-by-step plan from the bundled style guide and the target skill's structure, then execute the plan.

## Formatting Checks

Apply these checks to the target `SKILL.md` and any subcommand-like Markdown page that another agent may execute as a workflow.

- The file has a `## Workflow` section near the top.
- The workflow is written as numbered steps.
- Each workflow step is concise and points to a detailed section when it needs more explanation.
- Steps with several internal branches or substeps use a nested list under the main step instead of a long paragraph. Keep the nesting depth to three levels or fewer.
- Multiple-choice steps tell the agent which table, mode list, subcommand list, or procedure set to choose from.
- Multiple-choice steps let the agent choose the option that fits the user's task; they do not hardcode one option without evidence.
- Freeform skills tell the agent to use its native planning tool to plan execution from the available tools, constraints, subcommands, and user request.
- The workflow ends with a fallback for tasks that do not map cleanly to the default steps.
- The skill entrypoint has a concise `## Guardrails` section in which every bullet starts with `DO NOT ...` and prevents a negative action specific to the skill.
- Guardrails do not contain positive requirements, operation steps, workflow repetitions, or a second procedural checklist; those instructions appear in substantive skill sections.
- Skill-based use cases and chat-turn examples show the visible user prompt or user action and the expected final AI response shape; they do not include hidden reasoning, chain-of-thought, scratchpad notes, private tool-selection deliberation, or thinking process unless the user explicitly asks for that process to be documented. They also include a visible warning that the user/AI chat content is for example purposes only and that implementations should learn its style, intent, and semantics rather than hardcoding the example content.

## Subcommand Structure Checks

When a target skill has subcommands, choose the style guide's matching subcommand structure flavor.

Use the collection-of-routines flavor when subcommands are peer routines, tools, or functions with no normal calling order. Keep one plain `## Subcommands` table for this flavor.

Use the complex-procedure flavor when the skill describes a multi-step procedure, several steps have separate detail pages, predecessor artifacts matter, or shortcuts such as `fast-forward` and `step-by-step` are useful. For this flavor, split `## Subcommands` into:

- `### Procedural Subcommands` for user-facing workflow steps.
- `### Helper Subcommands` for lower-level implementation commands called by procedural subcommands.
- `### Misc Subcommands` for `help` and public shortcuts.

For the complex-procedure flavor, keep helper subcommands out of help output unless they are promoted to public workflow steps. If no helper subcommands exist, write `No helper subcommands are currently exposed.`

## Description Optimization

The `description` field in SKILL.md frontmatter determines whether future agents discover the skill. Apply these rules:

- Start with "Use when...".
- Describe triggering conditions and symptoms only.
- Do NOT summarize the skill's workflow or process.
- Write in third person.
- Include keywords agents would search for: error messages, symptoms, tools, library names.
- Keep under 500 characters if possible, 1024 maximum.

Examples:

```yaml
# ❌ BAD: Summarizes workflow
description: Use when executing plans - dispatches subagent per task with code review between tasks

# ✅ GOOD: Triggering conditions only
description: Use when executing implementation plans with independent tasks in the current session
```

If the current description violates these rules, rewrite it.

## Automatic Refactoring

When `create` or `format` edits a skill, task-specific detail is welcome but must live in the right place:

- Keep the `## Workflow` as a concise numbered list of steps.
- If a main step has several internal branches or substeps, present them as a nested list under that step instead of a long paragraph. Keep the nesting depth to three levels or fewer.
- Move task-specific procedures, examples, edge cases, and configuration notes into dedicated detail sections.
- If the skill has multiple modes, subcommands, or variants, create `references/<subcommand>.md` detail pages when the routines have their own executable workflows, then link them from the workflow or subcommand table.
- If the skill is a collection of peer routines, keep one plain `## Subcommands` table. If the skill is a complex procedure, use the three-type split from **Subcommand Structure Checks**.
- Preserve all domain-specific content: examples, guardrails, success criteria, and output templates. Only the structure should change, not the substance.
- Normalize guardrails into negative-action prevention: rewrite each retained prohibition as one `DO NOT ...` bullet, and move positive requirements or operation steps into the workflow, procedure, contract, or another substantive section without changing their meaning.
- When examples expose hidden reasoning or thinking process, revise them into observable response contracts: decisions, commands, diagnostics, files, validation, or next-step guidance.

The goal is a skill that is both well-formatted and rich enough to execute the user's task correctly.

## Editing Rules

- Preserve frontmatter `name` and `description` unless they are invalid or stale because of structural edits.
- Do not broaden trigger behavior while formatting.
- Do not rename public subcommands, files, or output paths unless the user explicitly asks or the current name is broken.
- Do not remove domain-specific guardrails, approval rules, or output contracts.
- Move long procedural detail out of the workflow into existing sections when possible.
- Add a new detail section only when no suitable section exists.
- Keep references one level from `SKILL.md` when the entrypoint needs them.
- Do not create auxiliary docs such as README, changelog, installation guide, or quick reference files inside the target skill.

## Validation

Run the platform validator when available. If a local skill validator such as `skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py` is present, use it:

```bash
python /path/to/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py <target-skill-folder>
```

If the current Python environment lacks validator dependencies, try the repository's managed Python environment before giving up.

## Output Contract

By default, `format` edits the target skill files in place and writes no analysis report. It returns a brief chat summary with changed files, validations run, and any unresolved style issues.

After validation, inspect changed files for:

- stale links to moved or renamed files,
- a subcommand structure flavor that does not match the skill functionality,
- missing `## Workflow` sections in subcommand-like pages,
- workflows without numbered steps,
- workflows without a freeform fallback,
- guardrails that do not start with `DO NOT ...`,
- positive requirements or operation steps presented as guardrails,
- accidental changes to trigger or output semantics,
- AI response examples that expose hidden reasoning or thinking process without an explicit user request,
- AI response examples that omit the example-content warning when the skill includes user/AI chat examples.
