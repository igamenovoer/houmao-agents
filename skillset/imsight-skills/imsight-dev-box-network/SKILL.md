description: Use when explicitly invoking imsight-dev-box-network, routing from another Imsight skill, or using Imsight context to configure, audit, repair, or document dev-box networking, SSH tunnels, proxy access, relay access, exposed ports, systemd user tunnel services, or host-to-host access. Do not use for generic networking tasks without Imsight context.

# Imsight Dev Box Network

## Overview

Use this skill as the entrypoint for development box networking tasks. Keep `SKILL.md` as a command router and load the specific networking reference needed for the task.

## When to Use

- Use for an explicit `imsight-dev-box-network` invocation or route from another Imsight skill.
- Use when `imsight` context requests supported proxy, tunnel, relay, port, systemd, or host-access work.
- Do not use for generic networking, proxy, tunnel, or dev-box tasks without Imsight context.

## Workflow

1. If no subcommand or actionable task is present, handle `help`.
2. Load the named networking page, or select the applicable subcommand or sequence from a task-only request.
3. Select any second-level operation from that page.
4. For `proxy-scan`, obtain the port range, run the bundled scanner, and persist candidates only when requested.
5. For `via-ssh`, distinguish dynamic SOCKS5 from forwarding an existing proxy before choosing commands or units.
6. For vague tunnel requests, ask for the required details; inspect current services and ports before changes.
7. Prefer user systemd for persistent tunnels unless tmux or foreground operation is requested, and apply the non-blocking unit rules below.
8. For cleanup, remove only the requested stale service or process and verify the intended reverse SSH access tunnel remains healthy.

If the task does not map cleanly to these steps, use your native planning tool with the existing networking references, bundled scripts, output contract, and safety rules; ask for missing topology instead of guessing.

## Invocation Contract

- Preferred explicit form: `$imsight-dev-box-network use <subcommand> to do <task>`.
- Proxy setup second-level form: `$imsight-dev-box-network use proxy-setup <subcommand> to do <task>`.
- Task-only form: `$imsight-dev-box-network <task prompt>` means choose the applicable networking subcommand or sequence from the task.
- No subcommand and no task means `help`.
- `help` summarizes this skill and lists the subcommands below.

## Output Contract

When this skill writes networking notes, scan reports, manifests, or other skill-owned artifacts, choose the output directory in this order:

1. Use the output location explicitly provided by the user.
2. Otherwise, use `IMSIGHT_SKILL_OUTPUT_DIR` when set; relative values are resolved from the current project directory and absolute values are used as-is.
3. Otherwise, use `<project-dir>/.imsight-arts/dev-box-network/`.

This contract does not replace intentional operational destinations such as copied helper scripts, shell startup files, or user systemd service files required by a networking setup workflow.

## Subcommands

| Subcommand | Use For | Load |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `help` | Explain this dev-box networking skill and list available subcommands | This entrypoint |
| `ssh-tunnels` | Set up, inspect, repair, or remove SSH reverse/forward tunnels | `references/ssh-tunnels.md` |
| `proxy-setup` | Set up proxy access, install proxy environment scripts, or scan proxy candidates | `references/proxy-setup.md` |

## Bundled Scripts

Use the bundled scripts instead of rewriting tunnel loops:

- `scripts/setup-ssh-reverse-tunnel.sh`
- `scripts/setup-ssh-forward-tunnel.sh`
- `scripts/scan-proxy-candidates.py`
- `scripts/setup-proxy.sh`
- `scripts/unset-proxy.sh`

Copy them to the target dev box when missing or stale, make them executable, then create or update the matching user systemd service.

## Safety Rules

- Do not store real host inventory, private IPs, public IPs, live ports, usernames, relay aliases, or service names from the current machine in this skill.
- Do not expose SSH login tunnels on `0.0.0.0` unless the user explicitly asks.
- Do not remove working reverse SSH login tunnels while cleaning unrelated forward tunnels.
- Do not embed credentials or private keys in service files or docs.
- Use `BatchMode=yes` for non-interactive connectivity checks.
- For systemd tunnel services, use foreground `--block` under `Type=simple`; do not use `network-online.target`, `ExecStartPre` connectivity checks, readiness waits, `--background`, or `nohup`; keep shutdown fast with `TimeoutStopSec=1`, `KillMode=control-group`, `KillSignal=SIGKILL`, and `SendSIGKILL=yes`.
- Do not create tunnel units that can delay boot, shutdown, or reboot while waiting for SSH readiness or graceful disconnect.

## Common Mistakes

- Guessing tunnel topology, aliases, ports, or exposure requirements.
- Rewriting bundled tunnel loops instead of using the supplied scripts.
- Exposing SSH login tunnels publicly without an explicit request.
- Creating systemd units that block startup or shutdown.
- Removing a working reverse SSH access tunnel while cleaning unrelated forwarding.
